Welcome to my YouTube Clone project! This application allows you to search for videos, browse videos by categories, and watch them, just like on the real YouTube platform. It is built using React.js and Material UI for the user interface, and it leverages the YouTube API via Rapid API to fetch videos.

# Features
- Search for videos: Enter your search query in the search bar and get a list of relevant videos.
- Browse videos by categories: Explore videos based on predefined categories, such as "Music," "Sports," "Gaming," and more.
- Watch videos: Click on any video to watch it directly within the application.
- Responsive design: The application is designed to work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes

# Technology Used
- React.js: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Material UI: A component library that provides pre-built React components following the Material Design guidelines.
- YouTube API via Rapid API: The YouTube API allows us to fetch videos, search for videos, and retrieve video details.
